# Social-Network-Analysis-Twitter
The growth of social media platforms in conveying the sentiments of the market presents an opportunity for businesses and social initiatives to make better-informed and accurate decisions. 
Social networks unearth opinions from relevant communities, predominant notions and popular entities within them. This project details the use of graph analysis of tweets from the Twitter API endpoint.

## Project Focus
From contemporary trends and events, The World Cup is chosen as an ideal use case to illustrate the effectiveness and value of this social network analysis. The data was collected on 24th October 2022 (before changes in Twitter API data access tiers) and features 12000 tweets within a span of the previous 7 days. The grouped (world cup) keywords search for a combination of the two words sequentially in a tweet.

## Installation
